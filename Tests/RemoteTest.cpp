/*  Tests for the phone-control server: address choice, the code, and the gate.

    The address test is the reason this file exists. A machine with Docker, LXD
    or libvirt has a dozen IPv4 addresses and a phone can reach almost none of
    them, so "which address do we print" is real logic that can regress
    silently -- the feature still looks like it works until someone tries a
    phone at a gig.
