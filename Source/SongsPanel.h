/** Building and playing set lists.

    Two lists side by side: every song this setup knows, and the running order
    of the chosen set. The gap this fills is that a song is otherwise only
    reachable by hand-editing the setup file -- the engine has known about songs
    and sets for a while, and the tablet plays them, but nothing here could make
    one.

    Built around Capture rather than a form. Getting a song right means picking
    the sound on each keyboard and settling on a tempo, which is exactly what
    the rest of the window is for; so you do that, then press Capture and the
    song remembers it. Typing program numbers into boxes would be the same work
    done twice, and wrong more often. */
