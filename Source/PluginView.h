/** A plugin's own window, shown on the tablet.

    Some plugins cannot be controlled any other way. Kontakt's host-visible
    parameters are its MIDI controller INPUTS: values go in, and nothing comes
    back out -- asking it what CC 12 is set to returns whatever was last written,
    not where the drawbar actually sits. Measured, not assumed. So a set of
    faders on the tablet can drive that organ but can never follow it.

    Mirroring the plugin's own window sidesteps that entirely: what you see is
    what the plugin is showing, because it IS what the plugin is showing.

    This is for setting up and adjusting, not for playing. A plugin window on a
    tablet is a picture of an interface built for a mouse, so expect to tap
    precisely and to miss occasionally. */
