/** A tablet as a program selector.

    Serves a small web app on the local network: each input with its current
    program, the list of programs that have something in them, and a tap to
    switch. It is a progressive web app, so it can be added to a home screen and
    opens fullscreen with no installing.

    Security: this binds to the local network, where a venue's wifi is not
    friendly. Every request must carry a token that is generated per run and
    embedded in the URL you scan; without it the server answers 403. That stops
    someone on the same network changing your sounds by guessing the address.
    It is not protection against someone who can read your screen, which is the
    right level for a stage tool. */
